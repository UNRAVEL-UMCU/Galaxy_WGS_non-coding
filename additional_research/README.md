## Additional research
In addition to the WGS non-coding variant analysis, the nuclear PPARA is imaged to show the PPARA binding in cardiomyocyte nuclei. This nuclear PPARA is analysed with CellProfiler with a speckle analysis pipeline 

## Scripts and pipeline
The CellProfiler PPARA speckle analysis is available in this GitHub. And also the scripts to visualize the analyzed PPARA speckles is provided in this GitHub

## Leica Thunder Imaging
The stained slides are imaged with Leice Thunder fluorescence microscope, according the protocol (downloadable in this GitHub).

**Note:** This research made use of Leice Thunder, but also confocal or other fluorescence microscopes can be used for imaging.
## CellProfiler pipeline
For the CellProfiler pipeline, the [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/releases) software is required. The pipeline can be downloaded, and uploaded to this software.

**Note:** The CellProfiler pipeline does not include images, due to GDPR compliance. Your own images are required.

## R analysis
The used scripts for visualistion are available in the directory: Rscripts

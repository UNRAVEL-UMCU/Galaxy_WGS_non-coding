## Additional research
In addition to the WGS non-coding variant analysis, the nuclear PPARA is imaged to show the PPARA binding in cardiomyocyte nuclei. This nuclear PPARA is analysed with CellProfiler with a speckle analysis pipeline 

## Scripts and pipeline
The CellProfiler PPARA speckle analysis is available in this GitHub. And also the scripts to visualize the analyzed PPARA speckles is provided in this GitHub
